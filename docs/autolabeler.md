# Autolabeler reusable workflow

[`.github/workflows/autolabeler.yaml`](../.github/workflows/autolabeler.yaml)
applies labels to a pull request from the rules in a release-drafter
configuration. A thin `autolabeler.yaml` caller in each repository
runs on pull request events and delegates to it. The workflow migrated
from `lfit/releng-reusable-workflows`, which it replaces.

## What it does

The lane wraps
[`release-drafter/release-drafter/autolabeler`](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter)
behind a block-mode harden-runner step. The action reads the
`autolabeler:` rules from `.github/<config_name>` and applies the
matching labels to the pull request.

Those labels matter beyond the pull request view. Release Drafter reads
them later to sort entries into release-note categories and to resolve
the next version, because each category in the organisation's
configuration carries its own `semver-increment`. A pull request that
picks up no label lands in no category and contributes no increment.

## The two triggers

A caller must trigger on **both** `pull_request` and
`pull_request_target`. Callers get this wrong more than any other
detail, and nothing reports the mistake.

GitHub hands a `pull_request` run a token without write access when the
pull request comes from another repository, so the labelling API call
fails there. `pull_request_target` runs with the base repository's
permissions and can label such a pull request, but carries more risk,
and using it for every pull request would be needless exposure.

The lane resolves this itself. Its job condition routes each pull
request down a single path:

| Pull request raised from | `pull_request` | `pull_request_target` |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | --------------------- |
| A branch of this repo    | Runs           | Skipped               |
| Another repository       | Skipped        | Runs                  |

Both events fire for a cross-repository pull request, so without that
condition the lane would label it twice.

The condition compares the head repository against the **base**
repository:

```yaml
github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name !=
  github.event.pull_request.base.repo.full_name
```

It avoids `github.event.pull_request.head.repo.fork`,
which answers a different question: whether the head repository is
itself a fork of something. In a repository that is itself a fork,
every internal pull request sets that flag, so keying on it would send
ordinary same-repository work down the elevated trigger. Both fields
here come from the event payload, which also keeps the check correct
inside a called workflow, where `github.repository` names the caller.

### The `edited` type

Use `types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, edited]` on both triggers.

`edited` is easy to leave out and costly to omit. Release Drafter
matches autolabeler rules against pull request metadata, and the
organisation's configuration matches on the **title** for every rule.
A title corrected after opening keeps whatever labels the original
earned. The common case is a pull request opened without a
Conventional Commits prefix, which the semantic pull request check then
rejects: the author fixes the title, the check goes green, and the pull
request stays unlabelled and so lands in no release-note category.

`synchronize` does not cover this, because it fires on a push rather
than on a metadata edit.

`edited` reaches half the problem. It cannot correct a label that
has become wrong, because the action never removes one. See
[Stale labels](#stale-labels).

## Why `pull_request_target` is safe here

Calling a workflow from a `pull_request_target` context deserves
suspicion, because the run holds write permission while the pull
request author controls the code. That risk needs head-branch code to
reach the runner, and here none does:

1. The lane has no checkout step, so pull request head source never
   reaches the runner, let alone executes.
2. `pull_request_target` loads the workflow body from the base branch,
   and a pinned `uses:` ref fixes the content of the reusable.
3. Every step pins a commit SHA and runs trusted code.
   `harden-runner-block-action` fetches one allow-list file and
   publishes it, `harden-runner` installs the egress filter, and the
   autolabeler makes GitHub API calls against pull request metadata.
   None of the three reads or runs head source.
4. Permissions stop at `pull-requests: write` and `contents: read`, and
   the egress block lands before the autolabeler step runs.

zizmor still raises `dangerous-triggers` on the caller, since a
reusable workflow has no trigger of its own to annotate. Silence it on
the `pull_request_target` line:

```yaml
  pull_request_target:  # zizmor: ignore[dangerous-triggers]
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, edited]
```

## Secrets

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

| Secret  | Required | Effect                                                    |
| ------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `token` | No       | Authenticates the autolabeler; empty uses `GITHUB_TOKEN`  |

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

Nearly every repository leaves `token` unset. Two cases call for one:
labels that must carry a different identity, and a downstream workflow
that has to react to the labelling event, since activity performed with
`GITHUB_TOKEN` raises no further workflow run.

The lane forwards this value to the action's `token` **input**, and
sets no environment variable. Both routes reach the action, so which
one wins is worth knowing. The action's Octokit client authenticates
from `process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN`, and the shared input schema copies
the `token` input into that variable **when nothing has set it**:

```js
// src/common/shared-input.schema.ts @ 34d80673
if (data.token && !process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN) {
  process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN = data.token
}
```

So a `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable takes precedence over the
input. Passing both would leave the input with no effect, and nothing
would report that. The lane uses the published input alone, which
leaves one place for a token to arrive.

## Stale labels

The action **adds** labels and never removes them. It builds the set
matching the configuration and calls `issues.addLabels`; no code path
drops a label whose rule stopped matching.

That bounds what the `edited` trigger buys. `edited` fixes the case
where a pull request carried no matching label and then earned one. It
does nothing for a label that has become wrong:

| Title change                 | Labels after     | Effect  |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| `Add X` → `Feat: Add X`      | `feature`        | Correct |
| `Feat: Add X` → `Fix: Add X` | `feature`, `bug` | Wrong   |

The second row matters more than it looks. The organisation's
release-drafter categories are `exclusive: true` and match in
definition order, highest `semver-increment` first. A pull request
carrying both `feature` and `bug` matches the features category first,
so a change retitled from `Feat:` to `Fix:` still resolves a **minor**
version increment rather than a patch.

Remove the superseded label by hand after retitling across types. The
lane makes no attempt to reconcile labels itself: it holds
`pull-requests: write`, and code that deletes labels could as readily
remove one a maintainer applied by hand.

## Dependabot pull requests

These work, and need no special handling. Dependabot raises its
branches inside the repository, so they take the `pull_request` route,
and GitHub honours the `pull-requests: write` grant on the calling
job. Verified against merged bumps in three repositories, where
`Label PR` reports success and the `CI` label — which no source other
than the title rule `/^ci(\([^)]+\))?:/i` produces — sits alongside the
`dependencies` and `github_actions` labels that Dependabot applies
itself.

## Config resolution

`config_name` resolves under `.github/` in the calling repository. When
that file is absent, release-drafter falls back to the same path in the
organisation's `.github` repository, which is how repositories in this
organisation inherit one shared label vocabulary without each carrying
a copy.

## Permissions

The lane's job declares `contents: read` to read the configuration and
`pull-requests: write` to apply labels. A called workflow never holds
more permission than its caller, so the calling job must declare both.
Omitting `pull-requests: write` produces a 403 at the labelling step.

## Why the runner must be Linux

`runs_on` must name a Linux runner, and the lane enforces that rather
than trusting it. harden-runner applies an egress policy on Linux
alone; elsewhere it degrades to a warning and returns success. Without
a check, a caller naming a macOS or Windows runner would get a green
job that applied labels holding `pull-requests: write` on an unhardened
runner.

A guard step fails the job when `RUNNER_OS` is anything other
than `Linux`, before the labelling step runs. It tests `RUNNER_OS`
rather than matching on the `runs_on` string, which would guess.

## Thin caller usage

Copy the caller from [`examples/autolabeler/`](../examples/autolabeler/)
into your project's `.github/workflows/` directory as
`autolabeler.yaml` and pin the `uses:` ref to a `generic-workflows`
release SHA.

### Concurrency

Set the concurrency group in the caller. Two details matter:

- Keep `github.event_name` in the key. The workflow triggers on both
  `pull_request` and `pull_request_target` for the same pull request,
  and a shared group would have one cancel the other.
- Key on the pull request number, not `github.ref`. On
  `pull_request_target`, `github.ref` resolves to the base branch, which
  would collapse every open pull request into a single group.

`cancel-in-progress: true` suits this lane, unlike the semantic pull
request check. Labelling is idempotent and publishes no check run that
a ruleset evaluates, so a superseded run leaves nothing behind for the
merge box to report.

## Gerrit support

None, by design. Gerrit projects review changes in Gerrit; their GitHub
mirror receives no pull requests to label.

## Migration from `lfit/releng-reusable-workflows`

Replace the `uses:` coordinate and rename one input:

```diff
-    uses: lfit/releng-reusable-workflows/.github/workflows/reuse-autolabeler.yaml@<SHA>
+    uses: lfreleng-actions/generic-workflows/.github/workflows/autolabeler.yaml@<SHA>
```

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

| Old input              | New input                 | Note                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `harden_runner_config` | `harden_runner_allowlist` | House vocabulary; pin bumped    |
| `config_name`          | `config_name`             | Unchanged                       |
| —                      | `runs_on`                 | New                             |
| —                      | `timeout_minutes`         | New; the old lane fixed it at 3 |
| —                      | `harden_runner_egress`    | New; the old lane fixed `block` |

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

The job name stays `Label PR`, so a ruleset or branch rule naming that
check keeps matching it.

The `token` secret carries over and behaves the same way. The old lane
exported it as a `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable and this one
passes the published `token` input; both reach the action's Octokit
client, so a caller already supplying a token needs no change. See
[Secrets](#secrets) for which of the two wins when a caller supplies
both.
