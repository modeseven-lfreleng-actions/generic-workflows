# Fixtures for the lint plan resolver in
# .github/workflows/linting.yaml.
#
# The resolver decides which hooks run, against which configuration,
# from repository content that a fork pull request controls. Getting it
# wrong is expensive in both directions: too strict and a mandated
# estate-wide check blocks merges on repositories with nothing to lint,
# too loose and a hostile configuration steers the job. Half these
# fixtures are therefore rejection cases.
#
# The resolver is EXTRACTED from the workflow rather than copied here,
# so there is one implementation and these fixtures always exercise the
# code that actually runs in CI. Removing or renaming the markers in the
# workflow fails this script rather than silently testing nothing.
#
# Usage: tests/test-lint-plan.sh

# Pick an interpreter that can import yaml.
#
# The resolver needs PyYAML, which reaches it by one of two routes.
# Locally, uv supplies it per-run. Under pre-commit/prek the hook is a
# 'language: python' hook whose environment declares PyYAML as an
# additional dependency, and pre-commit.ci's sandbox has no uv and no
# network to fetch one -- so requiring uv here failed every run there.
#
# Finding neither is a FAILURE, never a skip. A skip would let the
# hook report success without running a single fixture, which is the
# silent no-op these tests exist to catch elsewhere.
# The interpreter runs ISOLATED ('-I') under '--no-config', matching
# the workflow. Both are security controls there, not tidiness.
#
# '-I': the resolver is fed on stdin, so the current directory joins
# sys.path, and on a fork pull request that directory is the
# attacker's checkout.
#
# '--no-config': '--no-project' stops uv treating the checkout as a
# project but not DISCOVERING configuration in it, so a committed
# 'uv.toml' can redirect the index this '--with pyyaml' resolves
# from. Running the fixtures against an untrusted checkout without it
# would install a checkout-selected package before the isolated
# interpreter ever starts.
