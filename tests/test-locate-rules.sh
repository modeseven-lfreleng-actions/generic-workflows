# Fixtures for the shell decision rules in the locate step of
# .github/workflows/linting.yaml.
#
# tests/test-lint-plan.sh covers the Python resolver. The rules here
# sit earlier, in shell, and decide whether the resolver runs at all
# -- or whether the job is safe to run. Each turns an unknown into a
# verdict, so a wrong answer ends in a green check that linted
# nothing. For example:
#
#   dangling_component  - is the configuration really absent, or did
#                         the sparse checkout leave a symlink hanging?
#   org_status_verdict  - does this HTTP status mean 'no configuration'
#                         or 'could not find out'?
#   org_absence_verdict - a 404 on the file says nothing while the
#                         repository itself may be unreadable; was the
#                         file really absent?
#   skip_prefilter      - can a 'ci.skip' key be ruled out from the
#                         bytes alone, or must this parse?
#   harden_runner_verdict - is harden-runner actually monitoring this
#                         job, or did it return early and leave it
#                         unprotected?
#
# The authoritative list is the extraction check below, which fails
# if any named function goes missing -- so it stays correct as the
# suite grows, where a prose summary would drift.
#
# The rules are EXTRACTED from the workflow rather than copied, so
# there is one implementation and these fixtures always exercise the
# code that runs in CI. Removing or renaming the markers fails this
# script rather than silently testing nothing.

# Usage: tests/test-locate-rules.sh
